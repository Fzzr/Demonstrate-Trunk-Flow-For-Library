# Demonstrate-Trunk-Flow-For-Library
This repo is intended to demonstrate how I suggest handling git topology and versioning for libraries with multiple persistent major versions. It will be a straightforward trunk-based model.

# Versions
See [Versions](./VERSIONS.md) for the full list of versions of this library. This will include descriptions of what each version demonstrates.

# Process
See [Process](./PROCESS.md) for decriptions of the `git` processes to apply.
