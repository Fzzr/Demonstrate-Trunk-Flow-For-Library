# Demonstrate-Trunk-Flow-For-Library
This repo is intended to demonstrate how I suggest handling git topology and versioning for libraries with multiple persistent major versions. It will be a straightforward trunk-based model.

# Versions
See [Versions](./VERSIONS.md) for the full list of versions of this library. This will include descriptions of what each version demonstrates.

# Process
See [Process](./PROCESS.md) for decriptions of the `git` processes to apply.

# Acknowledgements
[Trunk-based Development vs. Git Flow](https://www.toptal.com/software/trunk-based-development-git-flow) - Konrad Gadzinowski, Toptal. The original reason I wanted to make this repo was to demonstrate how the trunk-based workflow described here would work in practice.
[FreeBSD Release Process](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/releng/release-proc.html) - FreeBSD Project. FreeBSD was my first exposure to trunk-based development and the diagrams here were helpful in visualizing the connection between branches and versions.
[NodeJS Release Working Group](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) - NodeJS Project. This provided me a practical model to examine when creating this repo.
