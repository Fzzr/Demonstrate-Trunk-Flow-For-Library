# PAST VERSIONS

## v0.2.0
This version is another prerelease. It contains some changes made with basic feature branches off of `master`.

It also contains commits demonstrating resolving merge conflicts. This is straightforward, but later we'll be demonstrating more complex ones, so these are here for reference.

## v0.1.0
Initial version. This shows the starting point for a new library.
