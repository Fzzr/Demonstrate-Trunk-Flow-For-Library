# Versions

This file will recount the versions of the "library", and also be used to demonstrate how to pull changes across different major library versions.

# CURRENT VERSION
The current version of this library is **v2.0.0-alpha1**.

# PAST VERSIONS

## v2.0.0-alpha1
Once a stable branch is created, `master` becomes the home of the next major release. Since we're out of prerelease 0.x versions we have to explicitly make all
future versions on master `alpha` releases.

## v1.0.0-beta1
This is our first release on a stable version branch. Here we will demonstrate how we use branches to lock down stable versions of a library.

## v0.2.0
This version is another prerelease. It contains some changes made with basic feature branches off of `master`.

It also contains commits demonstrating resolving merge conflicts. This is straightforward, but later we'll be demonstrating more complex ones, so these are here for reference.

## v0.1.0
Initial version. This shows the starting point for a new library.
